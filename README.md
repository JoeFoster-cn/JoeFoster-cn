  "firstName": "Joe",
  "lastName": "Foster",
  "age": 28
}
```

I'm currently enrolled on a 12-week [CodeNation](https://www.wearecodenation.com) bootcamp learning as much as possible about software development. It's demanding but lots of fun, I'm discovering new things every day and meeting the challenge head on!  On a normal day I'm a senior member of the team at [Bold Management](https://www.bold-management.com), we look after a bunch of different people doing all kinds of different things.

- ðŸ“« You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-foster-14b9b5106/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm ambidextrous (~~kind of...~~)  

:clipboard: I'm working my way through the coding world and have got a basic grasp of:
- [x] Javascript
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] Markdown
- [x] Git
- [x] React
- [x] Express
