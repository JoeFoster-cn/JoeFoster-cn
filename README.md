# Hello there, I'm Joe ðŸ‘‹

### Here's some info about me..

I'm currently enrolled on a 12-week [CodeNation](https://www.wearecodenation.com) bootcamp learning as much as possible about coding. It's difficult but lots of fun, I'm learning new things every day and meeting the challenge head on!  On a normal day I'm a senior member of the team at [Bold Management](https://www.bold-management.com), we look after a bunch of different people doing all kinds of different things.  

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to [LFC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/)!
- ðŸ“« You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-foster-14b9b5106/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm ambidextrous (kind of...)
